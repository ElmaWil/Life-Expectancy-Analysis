# Life-Expectancy-Analysis
**Life Expectancy Dashboard Report**

**By Ezichi Williams John**

## Overview

This dashboard presents a comprehensive analysis of global life expectancy trends, covering multiple countries between the years 2000 and 2015.It visually summarizes health, economic, demographic, and environmental factors influencing life expectancy in both developed and developing nations.  The dashboard is based on a **cleaned dataset** and structured **SQL queries** executed in **DB Browser for SQLite**.

## Objectives

The main aim was is to analyse the global life expectancy trends, how developed and developing countries differ, and understand how factors like adult mortality, GDP, schooling, health expenditure, diseases, immunization, and malnutrition influence differences between countries.

## Key Metrics

The Power BI dashboard uses **Card visuals** to show important summary metrics:

\- Average Life Expectancy    
\- Adult Mortality  
\- Average Years of Schooling  
\- GDP  
\- Health Expenditure  
\- HIV/AIDS  
\- Immunization Coverage  

Other visuals included:

\- Line charts for trend analysis  
\- Bar/column charts for comparison   
\- Slicers for filtering by year, country, and status  
\- A table for detailed breakdowns

## Insights and Findings

\- Life expectancy trendsgenerally increased across most countries from 2000 to 2015, showing global improvement.
\- Higher adult mortality strongly reduces life expectancy. Countries with high adult mortality consistently show lower health outcomes.
\- More years of schooling are associated with better life expectancy. Education influences lifestyle, access to information, and long-term health.
\- Countries with higher GDP tend to have higher life expectancy, but wealth alone is not enough. Some developing countries with good health systems perform well.
\- High immunization rates (Polio, Diphtheria, Hepatitis B) support stronger health outcomes and contribute to longer life expectancy.
\- Developed countries consistently show higher life expectancy, but developing countries have made noticeable progress over the 15-year period.

## Recommendations
Based on the insights:

\- Invest more in education, as schooling strongly influences long-term health outcomes.
\- Strengthen healthcare systems to reduce high adult and child mortality rates.
\- Improve vaccination programs, especially in countries with low immunization rates.
\- Increase awareness and treatment options for HIV/AIDS in regions that need it most.
\- Support health sector spending to help developing countries catch up faster.

## Conclusion
This project made it easier to understand how several indicators interact to influence life expectancy around the world. By using SQL for exploration and Power BI for visualization, the analysis clearly highlights the importance of factors like education, mortality, immunization, and disease burden.

The dashboard provides a clear and interactive summary, making it useful for analysis, reporting, and identifying areas where improvement is still needed. The insights gained here can help guide better policies, planning, and health interventions.
